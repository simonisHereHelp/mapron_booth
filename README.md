# Magic Apron TB

## D31 – Start of Customer Experience Joruney

Entry customer impact – CX journey start, first touchpoint; drives store sales + LTSA.

**Assoc profile** – Techy, capable of multi-tasking, but need better tools to address below challenges.

## D31 – Current Challenges


**Fail to Serve High Value Shoppers at Trip Start** – Customers seek direction at entry → Longer purchase list, harder to give accurate directions → D31 associates often **under-serve** these high-value shoppers, who would benefit from time-saving aids such as a printed **route map**.


**Cannot Up-Engage Effectively** – Up-Engagement demands experience; While SM has this expertise, D31 Assoc need tools to access it. Up-Engagement at trip start could generate sales, leads, or measurements, all of which are vital to Store Pulse. 

**Unable to Handle Merch Q&A** – Flex/under-staffing in store → D31 Assoc are often **subbed in to answer**, risk of revenue opportuinty loss when incomplete or subpar responses.
