# Magic Apron Booth Trial in Store 8949

## Store 8949 Needs

**1. to provide Assoc with better Message tools**

  - Every month, Assocs spend 2,000+ hrs on floor service.

  - Current GET method = loose, unstructured.

  - Need new tools ‚Üí enable Assocs to deliver precise, high-impact messages, used together with GET practice.

**2. to build Assoc's trust in AI at work**

  - Many Assocs feel anxious about AI's role in the workplace.

  - Must show that AI is here to support their work, not replace it.

  - To build trust, program should be driven by *SMs and Assocs*, not just the Corporate.

**3. to pave the way for Pro Accounts UO Program**

  - Pros can get real value from AI, but adoption‚Äôs been slow.

  - *User Onboarding* efforts (*workshops, free API access*) can build traction with Pros,and once it‚Äôs built, ensure HD‚Äôs leading edge in the long run.

**4. to receive budgetary support for this new trial**
  - the trial benefits both Store and Corporate; and Corporate should cover the cost.
  - Bulk of the budget relates to PM's bill time, per *Action and Deliverables* table (see below).
