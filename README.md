## Store 8949 Needs

**1. to provide Assoc with better Message tools**

  - Every month, Assocs spend 2,000+ hrs on floor service.

  - Current GET method = loose, unstructured.

  - Need new tools → enable Assocs to deliver precise, high-impact messages, used together with GET practice.

**2. to build Assoc's trust in AI at work**

  - Many Assocs feel anxious about AI's role in the workplace.

  - Must show that AI is here to support their work, not replace it.

  - To build trust, program should be driven by *SMs and Assocs*, not just the Corporate.

**3. to pave the way for Pro Accounts UO Program**

  - Pros can get real value from AI, but adoption’s been slow.

  - *User Onboarding* efforts (*workshops, free API access*) can build traction with Pros,and once it’s built, ensure HD’s leading edge in the long run.

##  Magic Apron TB & Localized Prompt Wizard

Magic Apron, HomeDepot's LLM, opens up new possiblities...

```
Core to this proposal is to create effective prompts for use with Magic Apron, and then convert the AI’s output into a Route Map format.
```
